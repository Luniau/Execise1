      Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in
      2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise
      share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a
      free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the
      last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower
      defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off
      zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications
      they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete
      freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.
